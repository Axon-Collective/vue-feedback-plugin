# Collaborator Agreement

By requesting edit access all collaborators agree to the following terms:
All edits and commits should progress the purpose of the project. 
Collaboratos may be removed at any time for any reason at the discretion of the governing body. 
There is zero tolerance for bigotry, hate or coarse behavior. 

This policy may be changed with the notification of relevant collaborators.
